# SF_Renting
I created this application, as part of my 100 Days of Python crash course, that utilizes Selenium Webdriver and BeautifulSoup to automate finding rent options in San Francisco using Zillow.com.  The information is sent to a Google Forms sheet, where the responses are then saved and could be queried by the user.
